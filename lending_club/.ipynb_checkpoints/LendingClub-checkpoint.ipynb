    "# Are religious Americans more likely to repay loans?\n",
    "The recent rise of peer-to-peer lending has been stunning. Starting from zero a few years ago, platforms like Lending Club are already placing $10 billion of unsecured personal loans per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is simple: a borrower fills in an application, investors choose to fund part or all of the loan, and the platform takes care of fine details, like collecting payments and annoying late borrowers. In theory, this disintermediation of banks from consumer credit lowers borrowing rates, improves investor returns, and leaves a healthy margin for the platform's profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platforms publish anonymized default history from previous loans. This data helps investors make smarter decisions about future loans - attracting more investment dollars. Investors use the data to try to pick loans with a high interest rate, but a lower likelihood of default."

    "This study has focused on a methodology for answering sociological questions and predicting defaults. Other issues to resolve for successful investing in P2P include:\n",
    "- API access: smart investors, such as hedge funds are rumored to quickly cream off the best loans. Any superior statistical view must also compete on execution speed.\n",
    "- Returns should be risk-adjusted for proper comparison to alternative investments, such as the S&P 500. An examination of similar grades of unsecuritized personal loans (credit cards) across the entire credit cycle would help capture both beta and true risk of default.\n",
    "- Lending Club uses NAR (Net Annualized Return, a non-standard method that assumes all current loans will pay 100%) http://danielodio.com/one-year-in-lending-money-to-complete-strangers-via-an-api-and-why-you-should-try-it\n",
